# Tic-Tac-Tok-Game-in-CLI
 
This project is a straightforward implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs in the Command Line Interface (CLI). Written in C, the game allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid.

Features:
<ul>
✅ Two-Player Mode: Players take turns to place their symbols ('O' for Player 1 and 'X' for Player 2) on the grid.</br>
✅ Input Validation: Ensures that players enter valid slot numbers (1-9) and prevents choosing an already occupied slot.</br>
✅ Win and Tie Detection: Automatically detects a win or tie situation and announces the result.</br>
✅ Simple UI: Displays the current state of the grid after each turn.</br>
</ul>
