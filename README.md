# Tic-Tac-Tok-Game-in-CLI
 
This project is a straightforward implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs in the Command Line Interface (CLI). Written in C, the game allows two players to compete against each other on a 3x3 grid.

Features:
<ul>
<li>Two-Player Mode: Players take turns to place their symbols ('O' for Player 1 and 'X' for Player 2) on the grid.</li>
<li>Input Validation: Ensures that players enter valid slot numbers (1-9) and prevents choosing an already occupied slot.</li>
<li>Win and Tie Detection: Automatically detects a win or tie situation and announces the result.</li>
<li>Simple UI: Displays the current state of the grid after each turn.</li>
</ul>
